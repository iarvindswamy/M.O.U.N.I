Activities Council
In a student's life, education is not solely about academics,
rhetorical studies, lectures and seminars but about learning many
more important social and life skills like leadership skills, group
dynamics etc., Which are considered to be highly essential elements
for a student to transform into successful engineer. And Vignan's
Foundation for Science, Technology and Research University truly
believes in this fact. To ensure sharpening of minds and
strengthening of souls, the students of Vignan have built their own
student body: the Student Activities Council.
The Student Activities Council of 80 members is elected annually
from among the nominees and selections done through a democratic
process involving a panel of faculty members and student
representatives drawn from across all departments. It has a
President, Vice Presidents, General Secretaries, Member Secretaries
and a Treasurer, supported by a sub-structure of various committees,
who plan, organize and execute a plethora of Co and Extracurricular
events and competitions on campus. The student activities council
has emerged truly on the distinct determination and inseparable
co-ordination of the students in working towards success. SAC is the
leading student programming board on campus. Here in vignan, SAC
aids in providing meaningful and enjoyable, social, cultural and
educational programs and events that appeal and are accessible to
the widest group of students possible, both on and off campus.
This student activities council ensures the students that their
journey in this campus is not just filled with intellectual studies
but with more involvement of passion, interests and creativity. SAC
extends its roots to every student who wants to develop
professionally, socially, contribute to a team and be inspiringly
successful.
SAC is diversified just as students are, into various departments
leading to more a tension free and peaceful work atmosphere.
Starting from team logistics, stage management, technical controls
through media and public relations ending in literary, cultural,
fine arts is the departmenting of this council. Student activities
council is established to be a platform with fostering leadership,
managerial skills and group dynamics. This is a stage where people
with vivid as well as similar mindsets meet, initiate, discuss,
share, and present their ideas. This council also envisions in
students being able to manage and maintain good relations,
networking and adapt the culture of work streams. Following a
typical framework and conventional functioning policies, the student
activities council will be active on a daily basis to keep up the
spirits of the inhabitants of the campus.
Thus ,the student activities council being the most happening
student body, is gripped as the backbone for all student activities
and has grown , is growing and will grow to be the most efficient,
reliable , effective student body. VFSTR's student activities
council works according to its motto that there are no secrets to
success. It's the preparation, hard work and learning from failure."

Since most of the students are from rural areas, the institution takes
appropriate steps to improve their oral communication and proficiency in
English. Each student undergoes training in three phases starting from their
first year to third year that enriches their communication skills. The training
programs are as follows:
TECHNICAL ENGLISH COMMUNICATION (TEC)
This program focuses majorly on improving the basic vocabulary that is required
for a student to participate actively in the classroom discussions. It helps to:
Strengthen the reading and listening comprehension skills of student to
follow the academic discourse in the engineering classroom.
Have a command of basic vocabulary related to different subject matters.
Have a grasp on the mechanics of writing and expressing the ideas
through construction of simple texts.
ENGLISH PROFICIENCY & COMMUNICATION SKILLS (EPCS)
The objective of this program is to introduce the specific uses of English to
students and to improve the language proficiency of students in communicating
the meaning verbally, as well as writing. In this programme, all applicants must
be able to demonstrate that they have the English proficiency required for their
individual program.
Students are provided with a platform to enhance their Reading, Writing,
Listening, and Speaking skills. These are measured by standardized and
internationally recognized tests, such as Cambridge English Language Assessment
which are usually marked on a band score. Preliminary English Test (PET) is one
of such Cambridge English Qualifications for which students are provided with an
opportunity to attend through this program. It is the English language exam that
shows you have mastered the basics.
English level B1 is the third level of English in the Common European Framework
of Reference (CEFR), a definition of different language levels written by the
Council of Europe. In everyday speech, this level would be called
"intermediate", and indeed, that is the official level descriptor in the CEFR.
